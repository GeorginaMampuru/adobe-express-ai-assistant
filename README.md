## Core Features

We've focused on three impactful features that combine advanced AI capabilities with visually striking elements, designed to impress judges and demonstrate real-world utility.

### 1. Instant Brand Kit Generator

This feature transforms messy branding into a polished style guide in seconds.

**What it Does:**
* Users upload **3+ images** (e.g., logo, website screenshot, social media post).
* Our AI **extracts core brand elements**: dominant colors, identified fonts, and general layout styles.
* It then **generates a downloadable Brand Guidelines PDF** and automatically applies these styles to **3 pre-matched Adobe Express templates**.

**Why it Wins:**
* Presents a **complete solution**, moving beyond mere technical demonstration to practical application.
* Offers a strong **visual wow factor** with both a professional PDF output and live template generation.

**Technical Implementation (Fastest Path):**

| Step                    | Tech Used                       | Notes                                    |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| **1. Image Upload & Processing** | OpenCV (Python) / ColorThief.js (Browser) | Extracts dominant colors                 |
| **2. Font Detection** | Tesseract OCR + Adobe Fonts API | Matches the closest available Adobe Font |
| **3. Layout Analysis** | OpenCV edge detection           | Detects basic grid and alignment         |
| **4. PDF Generation** | PDFKit (Node.js) / @react-pdf/renderer | Auto-generates the brand guide document  |
| **5. Template Creation** | Pre-made Express templates + CSS injection | Applies extracted colors and fonts       |

**Demo Script:** *"Watch as we turn this random startup‚Äôs messy branding into a polished style guide in just 10 seconds!"*

### 2. Trend Explosion Visualizer

This feature brings real-time data directly to the design canvas.

**What it Does:**
* Our system ** scrapes real-time design trends** from sources like Twitter and Google Trends.
* It then **overlays animated "hotspots" directly onto the Adobe Express design canvas**, highlighting trending elements or areas.
* **Example:** A tooltip might appear saying: *"Serif fonts are trending +37% this week!"*

**Why it Wins:**
* Leverages **real-time data**, giving a cutting-edge feel to the demo.
* The **animated UI** creates a highly memorable and visually engaging experience for judges.

**Technical Implementation (Cheat Mode):**

| Step                     | Tech Used                               | Notes                                  |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **1. Trend Data Fetch** | Twitter API / Google Trends API (Free tier) | Focus on 1-2 relevant categories (e.g., "fashion," "minimalism") |
| **2. Live Visualization** | D3.js / Canvas API                      | Creates floating dots with tooltips    |
| **3. Integration** | Adobe Express UI hooks                  | Overlays the visualization on the canvas |

**Demo Script:** *"See these glowing dots? They show you where to place text for maximum engagement based on LIVE data!"*

### 3. One-Click Controversy Check

This feature demonstrates deep thinking about design ethics and risk.

**What it Does:**
* The AI **scans the user's design for potential cultural or public relations risks**, analyzing color combinations and common symbols.
* It provides **instant warnings and suggestions**.
* **Example:** "‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid red/yellow in Germany (often associated with fast food branding)."

**Why it Wins:**
* Shows a **profound understanding** of design beyond mere aesthetics, addressing practical risks.
* **Easy to implement** with pre-trained models and predefined risk data.

**Technical Implementation (Quick Win):**

| Step                     | Tech Used                                   | Notes                                    |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| **1. Color Check** | Pre-defined "risky" color combos (JSON list) | Compares HEX codes against known conflicts |
| **2. Symbol Detection** | TensorFlow.js (pre-trained image recognition) | Flags common symbols (e.g., üö©/‚ò™Ô∏è/‚úùÔ∏è) in context |
| **3. Warning UI** | Simple modal + emoji alerts                 | Non-intrusive and clear user feedback    |

**Demo Script:** *"This AI just saved [Client Name] from a PR disaster ‚Äì imagine what it can do for you!"*
